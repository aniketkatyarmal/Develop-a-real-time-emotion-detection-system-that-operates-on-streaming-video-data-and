Real-Time Emotion Detection System
Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time emotion detection system capable of analyzing streaming video data. By integrating computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system can detect and classify the emotions expressed by individuals in real-time video streams.

Features
Real-time processing of video streams for emotion detection.
Integration of computer vision algorithms for facial recognition and emotion analysis.
Support for multiple emotions detection such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.
User-friendly interface displaying live emotion analysis results.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for system development.
OpenCV: Library for computer vision tasks such as face detection and recognition.
TensorFlow/Keras: Framework for building and training deep learning models for emotion classification.
Flask: Web framework for creating RESTful APIs for system deployment.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend technologies for user interface development.
